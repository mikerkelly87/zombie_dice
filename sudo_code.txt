Thinking a loud
--------------------------
Cup with 13 dice
6 = Green
4 = Yellow
3 = Red

Sides on a Green die:
Brains = 3
Runners = 2
Shotguns = 1

Sides on a Yellow die:
Brains = 2
Runners = 2
Shotguns = 2

Sides on a Red die:
Brains = 1
Runners = 2
Shotguns = 3
--------------------------
Turn logic
--------------------------
pull 3 at random to roll
Let the user know what color dice they picked
remove those 3 dice from the cup
User rolls
 for every brain add 1 to brain count
 for every shotgun add to shotgun count
 for every runner add to runner count
If shotgun count is 3 set all counts back to zero and end turn
Elif ask user if they want to keep rolling
 If user wants to keep rolling
  If runner count is 1 pull 2 dice at random and remove them from cup and let the user know what
  color dice they picked
  Elif runner count is 2 pull 1 dice at random and remove it from cup and let the user know what
  color dice they picked
  Else reroll the 3 dice already out of the cup
 Else add brain count to user score
